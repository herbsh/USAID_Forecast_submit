contraceptive_logistics_data.csv,average_monthly_consumption,"Average monthly consumption, for last three months. This is quantified in dispensing units. 
Note: Average monthly consumption in the system actually provides an average of the most recently available Normalized Consumption values. Normalized Consumption is the stock_distributed value adjusted to reflect any stock_stockout_days. Because months are approximated to have 30 days, one which had 15 stockout days would yield a Normalized Consumption of exactly twice its Monthly Consumption."
